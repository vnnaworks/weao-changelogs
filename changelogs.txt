v2.5
Semi lightmode fix
Updated sUNC model because it was pretty barebones but its still bad
Updated "WhatExpsAre.Online Status" to https://status.whichexpsare.online
Made bloxproducts advertisement black in light mode (looks better)

Discord isn't able to fetch the logo from WEAO for the footer image so i'll worry about that after migrating trackers
